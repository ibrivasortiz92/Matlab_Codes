Implementation in matlab of numerical methods applied in the neutron transport theory

## About
The solution of neutron transport equation in the discrete ordinates SN approximation is of great practical interest in the area of nuclear science and engineering. Several researchers have focused their attention in creating simple and accurate numerical methods in order to solve SN equations both for fixed source and eigenvalue problems. The goal of this project is to implement different approaches being used and develop some new features related. Different numerical schemes are implemented using Matlab and users can download and work directly with each numerical method.
